                    <p class="calisthenicspone">Calisthenics is a form of resistance training that relies on movements involving body weight only. These exercises can vary from the familar and relatively easy like the pushup and prison squat, which any person of average fitness level can perform, to the rarefied air of one-arm pullups, single-leg squats, tiger bends, and the human flag, which are feats that require years of training and dedication to attain. </p>
                    
                <p>Calisthenics training offers a slew of advantages over the conventional use of barbells and dumbells for exercise resistance. The most obvious being that no barbells, dumbells, exotic equipment, or gym membership is required to perform them, which not only means that it costs nothing, but it is also completely portable - you can do calisthenics at home, at work, at the playground...wherever you have prison cell size space, you can do calisthenics. Additionally, calisthenics is probably the best way to develop "functional" strength, which is the linchpin of successful performance in athletic competitions, since progressive resistance is centered on developing the strength to move your body in different and incrementally more challenging positions, not just adding more weight onto a bar while moving it in the same way. To illustrate, in the calisthenics model of training, when one reaches their goal of 50 pushups, their new goal becomes training their body to do 50 one-arm pushups - which requires not only more pushing strength but a different level of body control to accomplish - whereas in weightlifting, when you reach your goal of bench-pressing 300lbs, your new goal becomes benchpressing atleast 301lbs, which certainly requires more strength, but not the develpment of a higher level of body control and propioception to move their respective body through a more challenging range of motion.  </p>
                    
                    <p>Some of the fittest, strongest men to ever walk the planet were strong proponents of calisthenics including Jack Lelanne, Bruce Lee, and Herschel Walker. However, at somepoint in the mid-20th century, calisthenics got eclipsed and surpassed by (what became known as) conventional weightlifting as the number of calisthenics practitioners declined and its popularity waned. Perhaps, if Arnold Schwarzenegger was portrayed repping out muscle-ups as opposed to seated rows while training at Gold's Gym Venice Beach in the 1977 documentary "Pumping Iron" things would've been the other way around. Thankfully, due to calisthenics flag-bearers like the Barstarzz, books like "Convict Conditioning", and tv shows like "Ninja Warrior", calisthenics training, and its respective popularity, is undergoing resurgence, if not outright renaissance, in the early 21st Century, and due its dissemination through a medium known as the internet, will continue to grow and evolve to be bigger and better than ever. </p>
